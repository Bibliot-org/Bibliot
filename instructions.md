### Prompts used to create these summaries for the books
1. Navigate to [https://chat.openai.com/chat](https://chat.openai.com/chat) and register if you have not already done so. You should then see the chat interface.
2. To generate a summary for a book, create a prompt in the following format: "Write a summary for "[TITLE]" by [AUTHORS]" in one short sentence.
3. To generate background information for a book, create a prompt in the following format: "Write a background for "[TITLE]" by [AUTHORS]" in two paragraphs.
4. To generate an outline for a book, create a prompt in the following format: "Create an outline for "[TITLE]" by [AUTHORS]".
5. To generate content for a specific section of a book's outline, create a prompt in the following format: "Elaborate on "[SECTION NAME]" with more than 500 words". For example: "Elaborate on "II. The Importance of Monopoly" with more than 500 words". If you are not in the same chat window where you made the outline request, you may need to include the title and authors of the book and ask to elaborate on the specific section."
